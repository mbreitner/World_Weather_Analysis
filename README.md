## Overview of Project
- The purpose of this project was to create an easy algorithm to plot out a vacation trip. I used my API skills to accecss current weather data to help me create a dataframe of potential vacation destinations based on a temperature range. I then was able to take this newly created dataframe and connect my weather data to the google maps API. Once at this stage, I was able to see all of the cities in my desired weather range, where each of the cities was located, and the best possible driving route between each city.
